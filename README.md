miling connects us with others. It is a peaceful sign. Take a moment to think of any photo you have ever seen of the Dalai Lama. He’s always smiling ear to ear, his face radiant.

We know we can smile with our faces, but yoga teaches that we can also smile with our hearts. In Sanskrit, the Heart Chakra is known as “Anahata” which translates to “unhurt.” It means that deep inside each of us, beneath all the stuff, there is this place untouched by pain, mistrust, or hurt. It is a reservoir of ever re-generating love and abundant compassion. And the more we connect to our 4th Chakra (which represents the right to love and be loved), the more we feel an overall balance between giving and receiving in our lives. The stronger our Heart Chakra, the more able we are to share its qualities of unconditional love, compassion, acceptance and trust out in the world!

Smile! You are Beautiful.
Here are 10 reasons people should smile more:

Smiling is a Universal Language we all understand
Smiling spreads joy
Smiling makes you more attractive
Smiling is contagious
Smiling requires less effort than frowning because fewer facial muscles are used.
Smiling builds relationships. It bridges the gaps between us.
Smiling puts you and others at ease
Smiling makes you more confident
Smiling changes your brain chemistry
Smiling attracts more of the same energy* to you.


• Here is a super simple fact about energy: It is attracted to the same kind of energy. Like energy attracts like energy. When we breath, feel and live from our heart energy, we attract more of the same. This is otherwise known as the law of attraction
